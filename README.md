By: [Sydney Bear](https://github.com/sydnerd)

## Overview
Rock, Paper Scissors is an application which allows users to play the well known hand game virtually against the computer! There are two different game options: Classic and Difficult. The Classic game has the regular Rock, Paper, and Scissors options and the Difficult includes a Lizard and an Alien additionally.  

## Functionality
* The user can chose which game mode they would like to play: Classic or difficult
* Once the option is chosen, it will take the user to a view with images of all of the "fighter" options
* The user will then click which "fighter" they want to play and then it will show both the user's option and the computers randomized option
* Either the user wins, the computer wins, or there is a draw
* On the top left and right sections of the page, the application keeps tracks of all the wins for the perspective players and stores them to local storage
* If the user would like to play a different game, a "Change Game?" button will appear and the user can switch between Classic and Difficult.
