## Overview
Rock, Paper Scissors is an application which allows users to play the well known hand game virtually against the computer! There are two different game options: Classic and Difficult. The Classic game has the regular Rock, Paper, and Scissors options and the Difficult includes a Lizard and an Alien additionally.  The user will chose which game mode they would like to play where each button highlights the rules to each game. Once the option is chosen, it will take the user to a view with images of all of the "fighter" options. The user will then click which "fighter" they want to play and then it will show both the user's option and the computers randomized option. Either the user wins, the computer wins, or there is a draw. On the top left and right sections of the page, the application keeps tracks of all the wins and stores them to local storage. If the user would like to play a different game, a "Change Game?" button will appear and the user can switch between Class and Difficult.  

## Functionality
